* Promises :
- Promises are better ways to handle asynchronus code.
- similar to done() function.
- let us wait for some code to finish, before going to the next step.
- Synchronous code → waits until the task finishes before moving on.
- Asynchronous code → allows the program to keep running while that task takes time in the background.
- Asynchronous code allows your program to keep running while a task that takes time is being completed in the background.
